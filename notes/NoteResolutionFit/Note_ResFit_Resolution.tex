\section{Results}\label{sec:ResFit:Results}

The measured Gaussian resolutions, corrected for the effects of
additional jets and out-of-cone showering, are shown for different
\ptref in \qsubfig{fig:ResFit:ResoGauss}{left} for simulated
data.
Here, the \ptref are the mean values of the assumed spectra~$f(\pttrue)$
in each \ptave bin.
The error bars represent the statistical uncertainty from the
extrapolation procedure only (comp. the corresponding remarks in
\qsec{sec:ResFit:DataDriven:AddJets:Extrapolation}).
The measured resolutions are compared to the MC truth resolution.
The latter has been derived from Gaussian fits to the bulk of the
\mbox{$\pt / \ptgen$} distributions of the leading two generator
level jets in an event in small bins of \ptgen, as described in Appendix~\ref{sec:ResFit:App:MCTruth}.
There is good closure of the presented method.

The corresponding measurement in Collider data is shown in \qsubfig{fig:ResFit:ResoGauss}{right}.
The jet \pt resolution is underestimated by about $10\%$ in the MC simulation.
